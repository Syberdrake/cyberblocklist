# cyberblocklist
A list of crap to block in your hosts file. Seriously, just copy/paste it.

This was created with the purpose of blocking random, malicious websites. I noticed several places online had great
blocklists, but didn't do a good job of putting things into an intelligible host file.

To install, simply copy and paste the blocklist file into your hosts file (this should work on any OS). Right now it includes stuff from Adaway with another list of things to block Microsoft annoyances. I'm going to add stuff from Bluetack and Ublock at some point in the future.
